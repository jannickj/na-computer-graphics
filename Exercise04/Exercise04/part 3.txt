a)
shading is used make 2D objectslook 3D, by applying a little darkness to some areas
Lighting provides light on areas to simulate light hitting the surfaces


b)
gouraud shading is applied on a vertex level, while phong shading is applied on a per-fragment level. Gourad is cheaper but makes the model look more rough, and phong is more expensive but makes it look more smooth.


c)
Using point light, the light originates from a single point with a given direction, and directional lighting does not. In directional light all the light rays are parallel, and using point light the light rays starts from the same origin and spread out


d)
yes, it affects the specular lighting.


e)
it simply removes the specular component


f)
it makes it look more shiny, like polished metal, by increasing the intensity of specular lighting.


g)
we made no simplifications


h)
it is used to convert to normal vector into eye space. You obtain the normal matrix by taking the transpose, inverse of the modelview matrix


i)
eye-space
